## Description  

This repo contains all R code and smaller tables related to the publication xxx by Bäckdahl J & Franzén L, et al. 

In this project, we performed spatial transcriptomics, using the 10x Genomic's Visium platform, on abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) to generate data from a total of ten human subjects. The subjects are of a range of different ages and with different body mass index (BMI). Four of the subjects were subjected to euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with samples collected before and after – the data from these samples were used in the "insulin" analyses.
